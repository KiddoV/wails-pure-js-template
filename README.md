## About

This is a super simple wails template with basic web components (HTML, CSS, JS) without any front-end frameworks. 
You gotta to build everything from scratch. Good luck!

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
